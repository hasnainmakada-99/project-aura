🎯 **AURA OPTIMIZATION GUIDE - Personalized for Your Gaming**

## 📋 **Step-by-Step Optimization Checklist**

### **1. 🎮 Gaming Mode Setup (Priority #1)**
```
✅ In AURA Interface:
1. Check "Gaming Focus Mode (Safe)" ✅
2. Select "Valorant" from dropdown
3. Ensure checkbox turns GREEN
4. Look for "🎮 Gaming mode enabled for Valorant" message
```

### **2. 🎯 Focus Detection Optimization**
```
Current Settings to Try:
📊 Eye Openness Threshold: Start at 0.25 (middle)
📈 Focus Sensitivity: Set to 15-20 (High)

🧪 Calibration Process:
1. Sit normally in front of camera
2. Look at your screen like you're gaming
3. Adjust Eye Openness until you see consistent detection
4. Adjust Sensitivity until focus changes feel responsive
```

### **3. 🧠 Emotion Detection Tuning**
```
What to Watch For:
😊 Happy: Should detect when you smile/feel good
😤 Frustrated: Should catch when you're getting tilted
😴 Tired: Should notice when you're getting fatigued
🎯 Focused: Should activate during intense moments

Optimization Tips:
- Good lighting helps emotion detection
- Face the camera directly when possible
- Remove glasses if they cause glare
```

### **4. 🎧 Audio Environment Setup**
```
For Best Results:
🎧 Use gaming headphones (not speakers)
🔊 Set Valorant audio to highest quality
📻 Close other audio apps (Discord music, Spotify, etc.)
🔇 Let AURA manage audio priorities when focused
```

### **5. 🖥️ Multi-Monitor Optimization**
```
If You Have Multiple Monitors:
✅ Check "Multi-Monitor Mode" in AURA
📊 This helps AURA understand your behavior better
🎯 Tracks window switching and attention patterns
```

## 🔧 **Real-Time Testing Guide**

### **🧪 Focus Detection Test:**
1. **Start Valorant** (don't join a match yet)
2. **Watch AURA Status** - should show your focus metrics
3. **Look away from screen** - focus score should drop
4. **Focus intensely on screen** - score should increase
5. **Adjust sensitivity** until it feels responsive

### **🎭 Emotion Detection Test:**
1. **Make different facial expressions**:
   - 😊 Smile broadly → should detect "Happy"
   - 😤 Furrow brow, tense up → should detect "Frustrated"  
   - 😐 Relax face → should show "Neutral"
2. **Check emotion display** updates in real-time
3. **Note confidence levels** (higher = better detection)

### **🎮 Gaming Integration Test:**
```
During Actual Valorant Match:
1. Notice when STATUS shows "ACTIVE" (green)
2. Watch emotion changes during intense rounds
3. Check if you get break suggestions after long sessions
4. Look for "🎵 Enhancing focus frequencies" messages
