# 🛡️ Project AURA - Anti-Cheat Safe Mode Impact Analysis

## 🎯 **CAMERA DETECTION: 100% UNCHANGED**

### **✅ Camera System Remains Fully Functional:**

The camera detection system is **completely unaffected** by anti-cheat safe mode because:

#### **🎥 Camera Detection Components (SAFE):**
```python
✅ Camera hardware scanning          # Uses standard OpenCV APIs
✅ Camera capability testing         # Standard video capture testing
✅ Multi-camera selection dialog     # Pure PyQt6 user interface
✅ Camera permission handling        # Windows system APIs only
✅ Real-time camera status display   # UI updates and monitoring
✅ Face detection and tracking       # Computer vision processing
✅ Eye movement analysis             # dlib facial landmark detection
✅ Head pose calculation             # Mathematical transformations
```

#### **🔒 Why Camera Features Are Anti-Cheat Safe:**
- **Computer vision processing** ≠ Game audio manipulation
- **Camera APIs** are standard system calls used by legitimate software
- **Face detection** doesn't interact with game processes
- **UI dialogs** are completely separate from gaming applications
- **No game memory access** or process injection involved
