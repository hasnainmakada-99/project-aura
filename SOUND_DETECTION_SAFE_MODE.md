# 🔊 Project AURA - Sound Detection & Visibility in Anti-Cheat Safe Mode

## ❌ **FOOTSTEP DETECTION: DISABLED IN SAFE MODE**

### **🛡️ Why Footstep Detection is Turned Off:**

In anti-cheat safe mode, **footstep sound detection is completely disabled** for safety reasons:

```python
# RISKY MODE (Disabled):
❌ Real-time game audio capture
❌ Footstep frequency analysis (100-2000 Hz)
❌ Sound classification algorithms
❌ Audio confidence scoring
❌ Game sound detection
❌ "🦶 Footsteps: 0.8" display

# SAFE MODE (Active):
✅ Focus-based volume control only
✅ No game audio interaction
✅ Camera/face detection only
✅ Background app management
```
